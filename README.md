# Alt Storefront
This project aims to provide a more customizable storefront for the Saleor
e-commerce platform. It's based on Ant Design and Umi in order to make it easy to extend and customize, and also to reduce the complexity of the codebase. This project is still in its infancy and definitely not ready for
use in production, but you're welcome to experiment with it and give feedback and suggestions.

# Stack
To simplify development and to allow for easy customization, we've chosen
the following tools.
- âœ¨ Ant Design as UI framework
- ðŸ”¥ UmiJS as app framework
- ðŸ›  ReactJS as underlying UI technology
- ðŸª‚ Typescript for safety
- ðŸš€ Apollo as GraphQL client
- ðŸŒŠ DvaJS (based on redux) as a supporting data framework

# Getting Started
Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/khalibloo/saleor-alt-storefront/wiki/Getting-Started) on the wiki.

Here are the commands for running and building the project.
Install dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

Start the dev server

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Build app bundle. Note that Chrome browser is required.

```bash
$ yarn build
```

# Configuration
Refer to the [Configuration page](https://github.com/khalibloo/saleor-alt-storefront/wiki/Configuration-Options) on the wiki.

# Customization
Refer to [Theming](https://github.com/khalibloo/saleor-alt-storefront/wiki/Theming) and [Customizing the Home Page](https://github.com/khalibloo/saleor-alt-storefront/wiki/Customizing-The-Home-Page) on the wiki.

# Translating
All visible UI strings are set up in locale files to enable easy translation of the UI to different languages. Currently, only English and French (Google Translate quality) are available. Other languages will be slowly added after reaching a stable version. When that time comes, we'll likely need your help with the translations ðŸ˜‰

# Development Guide
We're fans of yarn. We recommend it over npm as it will allow you to have the exact same dependencies as specified in our lock file.

Generate GraphQL types for typescript whenever you modify a GraphQL query or mutation.

```bash
$ yarn codegen
```

Run unit tests to make sure things are in working order.

```bash
$ yarn test
```

Run end-to-end (e2e) tests to make sure the pages are working properly. This requires you to have the Chrome browser installed on your machine.

```bash
$ yarn test-e2e
```
